+ Projec title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
+ Project summary: I presented/trained three different types of models, in which model #1 is more advanced compared with model#2 and model#3. 
	(1) Model #1: 5000 Random Forests with 200 trees per RF (ensmble method, voting as ranking)
	(2) Model #2: distance (similar to recommendation system)
	(3) Model #3: 5000 Linear Regressions 
	
	Model training procedures: PCA (dimension reduced from 46 down to 19, which still explains 90% of variablity of the original feature dataset) + Random Forests on 5000 words (voting system)
